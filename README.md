## Holiday Spending Data Analysis (Sample of 25 Customers)
🔹 Step 1: Understanding the Raw Data

📝 Holiday Spending Data (Sample of 25 Customers)
1200, 850, 740, 590, 340  
450, 890, 260, 610, 350  
1780, 180, 850, 2050, 770  
800, 1090, 510, 520, 220  
1450, 280, 1120, 200, 350  

## Q1.What is the lowest holiday spending? The highest?
* Lowest Spending = $180\
* Highest Speding = $2050

Range = 2050 – 180 = $1870

There is a large variation in spending.\
Some customers spend very little.\
Some customers are extremely high spenders.

## Q2.Use a class width of $250 to prepare a frequency distribution and a percent frequency
| Spending Range | Frequency | Percent |
| -------------- | --------- | ------- |
| 0 – 249        | 3         | 12%     |
| 250 – 499      | 6         | 24%     |
| 500 – 749      | 5         | 20%     |
| 750 – 999      | 5         | 20%     |
| 1000 – 1249    | 3         | 12%     |
| 1250 – 1499    | 1         | 4%      |
| 1500 – 1749    | 1         | 4%      |
| 1750 – 1999    | 0         | 0%      |
| 2000 – 2249    | 1         | 4%      |

* 44% of customers (250–749 range) are moderate spenders.
* Only 8% spend more than $1500.
* High spenders are few but may contribute significantly to revenue.

🎯 Business Decisions\
* Target mid-range customers with attractive offers.
* Create exclusive packages for premium customers.

## Q3.Prepare a histogram and comment on the shape of the distribution.

If we plot a histogram:\
Most bars would be high in the middle ranges.\
A few extreme high values appear on the right side (1780, 2050).\

📈 Distribution Type\
Right-Skewed (Positively Skewed Distribution)

🎯 Interpretation
* Majority of customers are moderate spenders.\
* A small number of customers spend unusually high amounts.\
* The mean may be slightly inflated due to high values.

## Q4.What observations can you make about holiday spending?

🔎 1. Market Segmentation\

Customers can be divided into three groups:\

* Low Spenders: < $500\
* Mid Spenders: $500 – $1000\
* High Spenders: > $1000\

🔎 2. Revenue Strategy

Although high spenders are fewer:
Loyalty programs can be highly profitable.
Offer VIP discounts.
Introduce premium memberships.

🔎 3. Pricing Strategy

* The mid-segment is the largest group:\
Introduce combo offers.\
* "Buy More, Save More" schemes.
* Bundle pricing strategies.

🔎 4. Inventory Planning

Since most customers spend between $250–$1000:\
Maintain higher stock levels of mid-range products\.
Optimize inventory around mid-priced items.\

🔎 5. Outlier Analysis

* The value $2050 appears to be an extreme value.
* A data analyst would investigate:
* Was it a corporate purchase?
* Is it a data entry error?
* Does it belong to a luxury product category?

📌 Final Conclusion

This dataset shows:

* Significant spending variation
* Clear customer segmentation
* A positively skewed distribution
* Strong opportunity for strategic pricing and segmentation
